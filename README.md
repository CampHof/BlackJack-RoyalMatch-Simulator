# BlackJack-RoyalMatch-Simulator

I was at a casino playing BlackJack and noticed they had a bonus side bet you could make.

Royal Match betting 1 unit.  If your two BlackJack cards are:
 Suited:        Pay 3:1
 Suited K & Q:  Pay 10:1
 Unsuited:      Lose bet

I wanted to know the odds and return on investment for this bonus game so I wrote this to simulate hands.
