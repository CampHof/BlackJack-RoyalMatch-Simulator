# BlackJack-RoyalMatch-Simulator

## Introduction

I was at a casino playing BlackJack and noticed they had a bonus side bet you could make.

Royal Match betting 1 unit.

Hand is: | Payout |
--- | ---
 Suited | Pay 3:1
 Suited K & Q | Pay 10:1
 Unsuited: | Lose bet

I wanted to know the odds and return on investment for this bonus game so I wrote this to simulate hands.

## Outcome

After simulating 10MM hands:

Result | % occurance
-- | --
Match | 23.2%
Royal Match | 0.3%
Unmatched | 76.5%

Your return comes out to -3.78% giving the house the advantage.
